# Twitch Emote Booster

A webapp type game to get your Twitch emotes knowledge and typing skills up.

The game goes as follow : You are prompted with an emote and have to type it. If successful a new emote will be prompted and a point is added to your score. If you made a typo you loose a point.

Emote are sourced from the official twitch emotes API, the FrankerfaceZ API and BTTV API.

The game has several modes :
* normie mode (easy): 
    * This mode shows both the emote image and text to enter. It doesn't test knowledge. The emote are selected randomly from the top 100 emotes (by count).
* top 100 (normal):
    * This mode will show emotes only, no text. The emotes are selected from the top 100 emotes (by count).
* top 200 (hard):
    * same as top 100 but with a total of 200 selected emotes.
* top 500 (very hard):
    * same as top 100 but with a total of 500 selected emotes.
